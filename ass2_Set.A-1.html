        Dussehra (Vijaya Dashami, Dasara, or Dashain) is a Hindu festival 
        that celebrates the victory of good over evil. It is a gazetted 
        holiday in India, which is marked on the 10th day of the bright 
        half (Shukla Paksha) of the month of Ashvin (Ashwayuja), 
        according to the Hindu calendar.

    <p>Many people of the Hindu faith observe Dussehra through special 
        prayer meetings and food offerings to the gods at home or in 
        temples throughout India. They also hold outdoor fairs
        (melas) and large parades with effigies of Ravana 
        (a mythical king of ancient Sri Lanka).
        The effigies are burnt on bonfires in the evening. 
        Dussehra is the culmination of the Navaratri festival.
